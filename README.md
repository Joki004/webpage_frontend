CSS: Styling is implemented using CSS to enhance the visual appeal and layout of the webpage.

JavaScript: Interactive elements and dynamic content are added using JavaScript, creating a more engaging user experience.

PHP: Server-side scripting using PHP enables form handling and backend interactions, such as submitting data to a server and processing responses.
